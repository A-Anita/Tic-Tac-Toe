# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Java-based Tic Tac Toe game offers a modern twist on the classic 3x3 grid game. It is designed for two players who take turns marking their symbols, either "X" or "O," on the grid. The objective is to be the first to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
